  A [gun tackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_and_tackle#Overview) is a pulley system in which a rope is wound around two pulleys once each.
  One pulley is fixed, e.g. mounted to a ceiling, while the other connects to the load.
  As two parts of the rope act on the load, the system gives a mechanical advantage of two.
  In analyzing a tackle, it can be useful to "separate" the pulleys and mounting points to make the mechanical characteristics stand out.
  This diagram therefore shows a stylized gun tackle in a typical assembled form and a separated form.
